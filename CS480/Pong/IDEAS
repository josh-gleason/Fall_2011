Implement a breaking screen that displays a (possibly running) display of classic pong, then breaks into a number of traingles which fall (according to gravity) off the screen.  The tops of the triangles should be pushed in some (random) direction which causes them to appear as if they are split appart before they all fall.

The menu system should have Start, Options, Exit.

In the background of the menu system, there should be a running version of pong with CPU vs CPU.

Upgrades to pong (in order of importance)

  Round Ball.
  Neon!
  After winning, some sort of graphic happens
  Glow?
  curved paddles (to represent the deflection of ball more as it gets closer to the outside of the paddle).
  Possibly a rubber/deformable ball.
